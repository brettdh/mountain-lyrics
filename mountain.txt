See a light in the darkness
A city shining without a veil
This hill becoming a mountain
A solid rock that will never fail

Your name, my hope
Fortress in the raging storm
My heart is your home
Jesus, let your love take hold

The stone the builders rejected
Laid to ransom a fractured bride
Our crushing weight on your shoulders
You stand forever with arms stretched wide

Your name, my hope
Fortress in the raging storm
My heart is your home
Jesus, let your love take hold
(2x)

For your name, heart and soul
My life is yours, a living stone
For your glory, heart and soul
Surrendered all to build our home

Your name, my sure foundation
The hope of glory for one and all
Your love endures forever
A holy mountain that will not fall

All the earth, welcome home
In every heart, your will be done
All creation, welcome home
This hope is ours, your kingdom come

We cry holy, holy, holy
We cry - Holy is your name
