See a light in the darkness
A city shining without a veil
This hill becoming a mountain
And deepest valley cannot ignore

Your name, my hope
Leading me through calm and storm
Hold fast, my soul
On this rock I build my home

The stone the builders rejected
Laid to ransom a fractured bride
Our crushing weight on your shoulders
You stand forever with arms stretched wide

Your name, my hope
My weapon when the liar calls
Hold fast, my soul
On this rock I build my home

Fortress in the raging storm
The hope on which my anchor holds
A mountain when creation folds
Jesus Christ, my rock, my home

For your name, heart and soul
My life is yours, a living stone
For your glory, heart and soul
Surrendered all to build our home

Your name, my sure foundation
The hope of glory, my anchor holds
Your love endures forever
A holy mountain for one and all

All the earth, welcome home
With arms held high, we sing your song
All creation, crying out
With all of heaven, we sing your song

We cry holy, holy, holy
We cry - Holy is your name
