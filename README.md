## by Hillsong United
### Authors: Matt Crocker & Joel Houston

As far as I know, the earliest recording of this song
is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6ASC_Dej5g) from Hillsong Conference 2012. It was
later released as a bonus track on the deluxe edition
of [Zion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_(Hillsong_United_album)), and most recently as the final track
on [No Other Name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Other_Name).

This repo exists to show and discuss the lyrical changes
that took place since the "original" version. Here is a
[summary of the changes](https://github.com/brettdh/mountain-lyrics/commit/0f4daa4d540de39506c476e4be9a86314442d390).
